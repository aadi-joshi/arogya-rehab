# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Fix dependency issues (if any)

   ```bash
   .\fix-dependencies.bat
   ```

3. Start the backend

   ```bash
   # In a separate terminal, navigate to the backend directory
   cd D:\dyphackathon\aarogya-backend
   python -c "from app import app; app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)"
   ```

4. Start the app (connect to local backend)

   ```bash
   # In another terminal, navigate to the app directory
   cd D:\dyphackathon\arogya-testing\aarogya-app
   .\start-local.bat
   ```

   This will configure the app to connect to your local backend at http://[your-ip]:5000

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
